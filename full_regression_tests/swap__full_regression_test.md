EDGE CASES

- Non-Confidential Tx Input: There is an edge case that popped up where a user had received a lbtc uxto that was not confidential. Because Sideswap only works with confidential inputs, there was an error thrown. The solution was for the user to send those funds to themselves using Aqua to create a confidential utxo that would then be used for the sideswap swap.
