# aqua-test-scripts

There are currently two sets of tests in this repo, both manual testing scripts:

1. Smoke Test - This is meant to test critical and major functionalities,
to quickly identify any major issues or showstoppers early in the testing process.

2. Full Regression Tests - This is a suite of tests that drills down into every feature and
performs a thorough and comprehensive testing of the software. It covers a wide range of functionalities, 
including all edge cases possible (TODO).
